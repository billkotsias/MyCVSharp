NOTES

1) I think it is stupid to go straight to grayscale. IBO might give nice results with *SOME* images, but we are actually LOSING DETAIL by rejecting color.
I think the first step is to create a ROI by checking the box color; this SHOULD  help separate it from the background.

2) After creating the ROI, we could then convert to grayscale and search for Hough lines, contours etc.

3) Then, we should check the actual geometry: we are looking for the top rectangle-ish shape in the ROI.

So:

1) Reject all perimetric areas that are far-colored from the box's color. RGB -> HSL input conversion!
